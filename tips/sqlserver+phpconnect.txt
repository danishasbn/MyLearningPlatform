How to connect your php to your sql server?

step 1)

Check the version of your PHP by typing localhost:8000/ and click on phpinfo.Example my PHP Version is 7.2.0

step 2)
Download the SQL SERVER Driver for your php version
- I downloaded the 32bit instead of 64bit, the files are under "phpsql_ddl" folder
- copy the files and paste it into your exe folder -> path: C:\xampp\php\ext

step 3) Open php.ini and paste the following under extension
        extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv_72_ts.dll
        extension=php_sqlsrv_72_ts.dll

step 4) Restart apache or your computer/laptop

step 5) If error arises:

        error 1) Login Failed -> Go to SQL SERVER management studio
                              -> Expand the Security folder
                              -> Right Click on NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
                              -> Select Properties
                              -> Go to User Mapping from the left side menu
                              -> Choose your database for e.g. mine is MyLearningPlatform
                              -> And check db_owner
                              -> OK -> Run
